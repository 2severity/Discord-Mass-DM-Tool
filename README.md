# Discord-Mass-DM-Tool
A simple **Discord** tool used for **Mass DM** (Educational Purposes Only). Please understand that I am not repsonsible for the actions others decide to do with this code. 

# How To Use?
1. Download the tool (This repository). You can also copy the url and import this repository into **Replit**
2. You will need ```python3``` or higher.
3. Then you just run ```main.py``` in **Replit** or in **Visual Studio Code.**
(If that doesnt work, open cmd or powershell to that directory and execute this command): ```pip install requirements.txt -r```

# Commands

```CT``` = Checks the ```tokens.txt``` if there are any invalid tokens (Bot Token Checker).
```MD``` = Mass DM

# Discord Commands

If you executed the ```MD``` command in and have all tokens in the server, you can now spam, to spam you need to execute a command for that, the command is:
(prefix)dm (messages to send per bot) (user id)


To stop the bots, execute this command: ```(prefix)stop```
